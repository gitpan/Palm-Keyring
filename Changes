0.95	Support v5 databases - it needs more testing though.

0.94    tar it up on OS X because the tar on OpenBSD-current that I was 
        using is apparently broken.

0.93    Initial public release.  I have had a lot of help getting my first
        module release, please see the THANKS section of the documentation.
