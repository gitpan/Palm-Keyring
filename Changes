0.96_06	Fix a weird bug where real life differs from the docs.  There is 
	an FF FF between records in a real Keyring generated file that I was 
	not inserting.  It is number 30549 on rt.cpan.org.

	I also did some cleanup of some other stuff.  Like not encrypting 
	and storing a second time fields with a label_id.of 0.

0.96_0[1..5]	Different builds to get it to pass on as many of the CPAN 
	automated testing platforms as I can.  Mostly just screwups with YAML 
	cruft being left in the .t files.

0.96	Switch to using a record format that is more like what is used
	in Keyring v5.  Fake v4 databases so that the programmer doesn't 
	have to know.

0.95	Support v5 databases - it needs more testing though.

0.94    tar it up on OS X because the tar on OpenBSD-current that I was 
        using is apparently broken.

0.93    Initial public release.  I have had a lot of help getting my first
        module release, please see the THANKS section of the documentation.
